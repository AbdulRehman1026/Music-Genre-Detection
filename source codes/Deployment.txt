🎶 MUSIC GENRE DETECTION WEB APP – PROJECT PLAN 📁

🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This web app allows users to detect the genre of any music/audio clip using a deep CNN model trained on the GTZAN dataset with Mel spectrogram features. It supports multiple input methods and is designed to be user-friendly, interactive, and impressive to showcase deep learning in real-world use.

✅ FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. 🎧 Upload Audio File
   - User uploads an `.mp3` or `.wav` file.
   - App processes it into a Mel spectrogram.
   - The model predicts and displays the genre.

2. 🔗 Paste YouTube Link
   - User pastes a YouTube video URL.
   - The app downloads the first 30 seconds of audio.
   - Converts to Mel spectrogram → predicts genre.

3. 🎤 Record via Microphone
   - User records live audio (sing, speak, or play music).
   - Recording is processed and classified into a genre.

4. 🧠 Output Features
   - Display predicted genre + confidence score.
   - Optionally show top-3 genres.
   - Show the spectrogram that was used for prediction.
   - Optional tab to show model accuracy/confusion matrix.

🧱 TECH STACK & WHY:

🔙 BACKEND: **FastAPI**
- Fast and asynchronous — handles YouTube downloading and file processing well.
- Easy integration with ML models (TensorFlow / PyTorch).
- Exposes REST APIs for audio upload, YouTube link, and mic input.

📦 MODEL:
- Format: `.h5` (TensorFlow/Keras) or `.pt` (PyTorch)
- Model trained on GTZAN using Mel spectrograms and deep CNN architecture.

🎵 AUDIO PROCESSING:
- `librosa`: Extract Mel spectrograms.
- `pydub` + `ffmpeg`: Audio format conversion.
- `yt-dlp`: Download audio from YouTube URLs.
- `soundfile`: Save audio from mic blobs.

🎨 FRONTEND OPTIONS:

🟢 Option 1: **Gradio**
- Fastest to deploy and test.
- Built-in support for audio upload, mic recording.
- Custom block for YouTube link input.
- Ideal for demos and Hugging Face deployment.

🔵 Option 2: **React.js + Tailwind CSS**
- Custom, modern, polished frontend.
- Lets you build a beautiful UI for users.
- Fetches results from FastAPI via REST endpoints.

🛠 Optional Frontend Features:
- Progress bar while analyzing.
- Real-time waveform display.
- "Try Sample" button for demo testing.

🌍 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:

1. **Hugging Face Spaces** – Ideal for Gradio apps.
2. **Render / Railway** – For full FastAPI + React stack.
3. **Dockerized Deployment** – Works on any cloud or local server.
