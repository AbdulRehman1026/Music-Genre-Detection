# 🎵 Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop an effective music genre classification system using deep learning and the GTZAN dataset. By transforming raw audio signals into Mel-spectrograms and training a deep convolutional neural network, the system is designed to accurately categorize music tracks into one of ten predefined genres.

## 📁 Dataset

**GTZAN Genre Collection**  
- 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock  
- 100 tracks per genre  
- Each track is 30 seconds long  
- Dataset Reference: *Tzanetakis & Cook, 2002*

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Define and understand the music‑genre classification problem  
- Explore and visualize the audio dataset to grasp its distribution and quality  
- Transform raw audio into rich representations (e.g., Mel‑spectrograms)  
- Train a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) for genre prediction  
- Fine‑tune deeper convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) on the dataset to boost accuracy  
- Evaluate models comprehensively — using accuracy, confusion matrix, and bias‑variance diagnostics — to verify balanced generalization
